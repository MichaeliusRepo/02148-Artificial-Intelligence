# 02148 Artificial Intelligence
This project contains a simple implementation of the ![A* search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm), written in C#.

The console program contains two examples of A* use. The first example is route finding on a simplified map of Copenhagen. The second example is using A* on graphs for propositional logic, specifically ![logical resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_%28logic%29).

During development, an aim was to use minimal code. In total, all written C# code amounts to only 300 lines.
